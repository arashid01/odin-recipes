HTML practice for The Odin Project

This project is a simple example demonstrating the basic HTML tags I have learned so far in The Odin Project. It includes following a standard boilerplate, adding meta tags in the ```<head>```, and creating a simple page in the ```<body>``` that links to different recipe pages.
The exercise aims to test my ability to successfully construct a basic HTML page structure, understand and apply tags, and work with file structures to organize a project.
Additionally, it helps me understand how to use different types of images (JPG, PNG, GIF, and SVG) and the best use cases for each.
