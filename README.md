HTML practice for The Odin Project

This project is a simple example demonstrating the basic HTML tags I have learned so far in The Odin Project. It includes following a standard boilerplate, adding meta tags in the <head>, and creating a simple page in the <body> that links to different recipe pages.
The exercise aims to test my ability to successfully construct a basic HTML page structure, understand and apply semantic tags, and make the content user-friendly, especially for people with visual impairments who use screen readers to browse the web.
It also tests my understanding of different types of images â€” such as JPG, PNG, GIF, and SVG, and the best use cases for each.
