		<h1>Dill Pickle Chicken Skewers</h1>
		<img src="../images/skewers.jpg" alt="Lasagna">

		<h2>Description</h2>
		<p>
			This flavorful dish features boneless chicken thighs marinated
			 in pickle brine, then threaded onto skewers with slices of 
			 pickle. The skewers are seared in a grill pan and baked until 
			 cooked through. The finishing touch is a tangy, buttery garlic 
			 ranch sauce that adds a rich and zesty flavor to each bite.
		</p>

		<h2>Ingredients</h2>
		<h3>Skewers</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>1 (24 ounce) jar dill pickle chips</li>
			<li>1 tablespoon packed light brown sugar</li>
			<li>1 3/4 teaspoons kosher salt, divided</li>
			<li>1 pound skinless, boneless chicken thighs, excess fat trimmed, cut into 2-inch pieces</li>
			<li>4 teaspoons olive oil</li>
			<li>1 1/2 teaspoons ranch dressing mix</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Sauce</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>4 tablespoons unsalted butter, divided </li>
			<li>1 garlic clove, minced</li>
			<li>1/4 cup reduced-sodium chicken broth</li>
			<li>1 tablespoon ranch dressing mix</li>
			<li>2 teaspoons chopped fresh dill, plus more for garnish</li>
			<li>1/8 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Steps</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
			<li>For skewers, open pickle jar and transfer pickles to a small bowl using a fork, leaving pickle juice in the jar. Set aside.</li>
			<li>In the jar with pickle juice, add brown sugar and 1 teaspoon salt; whisk until dissolved. Add chicken to the jar, making sure all pieces are submerged. Cover and refrigerate for at least 3 hours or up to 12 hours.</li>
			<li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a rimmed baking sheet with aluminum foil.</li>
			<li>Remove chicken pieces from pickle juice; discard juice. Thread 1 chicken piece followed by 3 pickle chips onto an 8-inch skewer; repeat layers once, then finish with a third chicken piece. Continue threading remaining chicken and pickles onto skewers as needed; reserve any extra pickles for another use. Place skewers on the prepared baking sheet; pat dry using paper towels. Evenly brush skewers with oil. Sprinkle chicken pieces evenly with ranch dressing mix and remaining 3/4 teaspoon salt.</li>
			<li>Heat a grill pan over medium-high heat until water sprinkled on immediately sizzles. Grill skewers, pressing down on chicken as needed, just until marks form on two sides, about 1 minute per side. Return skewers to baking sheet.</li>
			<li>Bake in the preheated oven until an instant-read thermometer inserted in the thickest part of the chicken registers at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C), 7 to 12 minutes.</li>
			<li>Meanwhile, for sauce, melt 3 tablespoons butter in a saucepan over medium heat; add garlic and cook, stirring constantly, until butter starts to brown and garlic is lightly golden, about 30 seconds. Remove from heat; whisk in broth, ranch dressing mix, dill, and salt until well combined. Whisk in remaining 1 tablespoon butter until melted and emulsified.</li>
			<li>Transfer skewers to a serving plate; drizzle with sauce and serve immediately. Garnish with more dill, if desired.</li>
			<li>Enjoy!</li>
